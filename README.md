# Digital Confidence: Tools for Safe Online Participation  

## Project Overview  
This project explores how **communities, governments, and organizations** can enhance **digital safety and trust** to protect vulnerable populations and enable secure, meaningful participation in digital platforms.  

The analysis is based on the dataset **`digital-project-data_v2.csv`**, which contains **91 Australian Government digital projects**.  
We used **R** to analyze the dataset, generate visualizations, and extract insights about **investment priorities, agency roles, and timelines** for digital trust initiatives.

## Data Analysis – Key Findings  
- Around **40% of projects** are directly related to digital trust (scam protection, privacy, health, identity, inclusion).  
- High-budget projects such as the **Digital ID Program** and the **National Criminal Intelligence System** demonstrate strong government commitment to **security and trust**.  
- Leading agencies include **ACMA, ACCC, ACIC, and ADHA**, showing **cross-agency collaboration**.  
- Most projects are planned for **completion in 2025–2026**, making this a **critical window** for adoption, education, and community engagement.  
- Scam-related projects have smaller budgets, but are **especially important for seniors, migrants, and children**.

## Visualizations  
We created multiple plots to illustrate government investment patterns:  
- **Top 10 Theme-Related Projects by Budget**  
- **Top 10 Agencies by Project Count**  
- **Projects by End Year**  
- **Annual Budgets by Tags** (Identity, Security, Inclusion, Scam, Health)  
- **Annual Project Counts by Tags**  

These visualizations provide evidence of **funding priorities, responsible agencies, and implementation timelines**.

## Technology Stack  
- **Programming Language:**  
  - R (tidyverse, ggplot2, lubridate, readr, dplyr, stringr, scales)  

- **Tools:**  
  - RStudio  
  - GitHub (for version control and collaboration)  

- **Visualization:**  
  - ggplot2 (bar charts, line charts, time distributions, agency comparisons)

## Impact & Recommendations  

Government investments prioritize **identity, inclusion, security, and scam prevention**.  

To maximize impact, we recommend:  
- **Trusted access**: Digital ID as a secure gateway  
- **Inclusive design**: Multi-language support, accessibility features, digital skills programs  
- **Built-in safeguards**: Anti-scam alerts, privacy by default  
- **Digital literacy**: Education and training for vulnerable groups  

These measures ensure that digital transformation is **secure, trusted, and inclusive for all**.
